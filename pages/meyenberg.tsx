      <Details image="Dead pile.jpg">
        In early 2025, DxE investigators discovered a massive, illegal dead pile at Vera Goat Dairy, a "Certified Humane," Whole Foods-supplying goat dairy in California's Central Valley. They observed dozens of dead mother and baby goats being dumped on a regular basis, and they began a months-long investigation into the facility to find out why so many animals were dying. Vera supplies the nation's largest goat milk producer, Meyenberg Dairy. Inside Vera, investigators documented mothers with engorged and distended teats, animals with respiratory infections, and violations of both "Certified Humane" standards and state animal cruelty laws. {" "}

      <Details image="5:27 Rescue.png">
        An attorney on DxE's legal team repeatedly reported these violations to the local authorities, including the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) which had cited Vera in 2021 for illegally disposing of dead animals on site. But the authorities failed to take enforcement action against Vera. So DxE investigators went back to Vera on May 27, 2025 to document the conditions again in broad daylight, and they rescued two sick baby goats with eye and nasal discharge. They carried the goats, whom they named Phoebe and Celia, to safety.

        Then, they returned to the facility with dozens of other activists to tell the authorities about the conditions they had just witnessed and urge them to investigate Vera's animal cruelty. Instead, the Kings County Sheriff arrested the five rescuers. Joe, Carla, Taj, Yasirah, and Sally were released after a couple of hours in custody with certificates of release saying no charges are yet filed, pending further investigation. We are now waiting to see if Kings County will file charges against these compassionate animal rescuers.
