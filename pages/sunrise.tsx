      <Details image="sunrise.jpg">
        Over 100 people have been arrested on felony charges for taking
        nonviolent direct action to help suffering animals at factory farms in
        Sonoma County, after the government ignored repeated reports of criminal
        animal cruelty. In October 2018, a small group of activists were charged
        with seven felonies each for two actions at factory farms which occurred
        in May 2018 (at Sunrise Farms) and September 2018 (at McCoy's Poultry, a
        supplier to Petaluma Poultry). The DA filed additional charges following
        a third action in June 2019 (at Reichardt Duck Farm). Since then, the
        prosecution has dismissed all of the charges related to the action at
        McCoy's and amended the charges to remove all mention of burglary and
        theft, leaving only conspiracy to commit trespass and trespass. Trial
        starts September 8 for Cassie, Priya, and Wayne, and it is expected to
        last three weeks. Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) is organizing
        a convergence during the trial to support the defendants and the right
        to rescue. Register for the trial support convergence&nbsp;
