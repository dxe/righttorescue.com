      <Details image="sunrise.jpg">
        Over 100 nonviolent activists have been arrested at factory farms in
        Sonoma County for taking direct action to help suffering animals after
        the government ignored repeated reports of criminal animal cruelty.
        Thirteen activists face criminal charges, including a total of 47
        felonies. Trial was expected to begin in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic
        delayed the court schedule. Four felony defendants have preliminary
        hearings set for November 2021, and two felony defendants have
        preliminary hearings set for January 2022.
