      <Details image="sunrise.jpg">
        Over 100 nonviolent activists have been arrested at factory farms in
        Sonoma County for taking direct action to help suffering animals after
        the government ignored repeated reports of criminal animal cruelty.
        Six activists face felony charges stemming from 3 nonviolent direct actions at factory farms which occurred in May 2018, September 2018, and June 2019. Preliminary hearings finally happened on December 5, 2022 for two of the defendants, Rachel and Jon. The judge ruled that there was enough evidence for the case to continue to trial. Preliminary hearings began in November 2021 for the other four defendants, and are scheduled to conclude January 18-19, 2023. Trial is expected in 2023 for all six defendants.

          Judge Wilcox ruled, over the defense's objection, to make the jury
          anonymous. It’s a move typically reserved for trials involving violent
          organized crime, with only one known use in Utah history, before now.
          This decision could indicate to jurors that the defendants are violent
          people to be feared, instead of compassionate individuals trying to
          protect the most vulnerable.

          MOTION GRANTED! Wayne and Paul won their motion for a new jury and
          trial location because the judge agreed that Smithfield and police had
          biased people in Beaver County, Utah. The #SmithfieldTrial will now
          take place in Washington County, Utah. This is a win for the legal
          case, as the jury pool in Washington County is less financially
          dependent on Smithfield. As a result of this change in venue, the
          trial has also been delayed to October 3-7. Please share this news

          Former Baywatch star Alexandra Paul and co-defendant Alicia Santurio
          entered “not guilty” pleas in a new rescue case. In September 2021,
          activists rescued birds from a slaughter truck that was stopped on its
          way into the Foster Farms slaughterhouse in Livingston, CA. In Spring
          2022, Alexandra and Alicia received theft charges in the mail related
          to this rescue.

          Utah Judge Jeffrey C. Wilcox, who will preside over the
          #SmithfieldTrial, granted the State’s request to exclude the Operation
          Deathstar video and all evidence of “inhumane animal conditions” at
          trial, except to prove the value of the specific piglets who were
          rescued, Lily and Lizzie. The State argued that the footage would be
          prejudicial because it would arouse horror in the jury, but that is
          exactly why the jury should be allowed to see it.

          VICTORY! Just one day before trial was set to begin, all charges
          against DxE investigator Matt Johnson were DROPPED. International
          media outlets had requested coverage and people from around the
          country were planning to attend the trial to support the right to
          rescue. Could it be that the industry got scared of the public

          in court, but instead of going away, we are now using this victory as
          an opportunity to keep fighting "ag-gag" laws and defending the Right
          to Rescue.
