      <Details image="sf-ut-2.jpg">
        In 2017, activists rescued two piglets, Lily and Lizzie, from a Utah
        factory farm owned by Smithfield Foods, the largest pig-killing company
        in the world. Their story went viral when the FBI started hunting for
        the piglets, raiding sanctuaries and even cutting off part of a pigâ€™s
        ear to do DNA testing. Two of the rescuers are facing 60 years in
        prison. Their trial was delayed due to the pandemic; it is expected to
        take place in 2022.

      <Defendants>
        <Defendant name="Paul Darwin Picklesimer" image="sf-ut-paul.jpg">
          When Paul was a roofer in West Virginia, they worked on farms and saw
          animal abuse up close. Those experiences helped lead them to becoming
          an animal rights activist.

        <Defendant name="Wayne Hsiung" image="sf-ut-wayne.jpg">
          Wayne was a lawyer with DLA Piper before co-founding the animal rights
          network, Direct Action Everywhere. He has investigated dozens of farms
          and currently faces 16 felonies for rescuing sick animals.
