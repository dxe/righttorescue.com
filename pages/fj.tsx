        Seven activists were arrested while attempting to rescue a pig they
        named Greta from inside Farmer John slaughterhouse in Los Angeles.
        Farmer John is Smithfield’s largest West Coast slaughterhouse where more
        than 7,000 pigs are killed every day. It was also the site of a massive
        COVID outbreak in 2020 where 1 in 2 workers at the facility were
        infected. A few days after the attempted rescue, around 200 people
        united at the slaughterhouse to protest Smithfield’s abuse of animals
        and workers. Dozens more people were arrested during a lockdown at the
        facility. Most had no charges filed against them. The police filed
        felony charges against the seven people who tried to save Greta, but the
        District Attorney has so far chosen not to pursue the case.
