        County, including Petaluma Poultry, a subsidiary of poultry giant Perdue. Instead of
        prosecuting these companies, the Sonoma County District Attorney has gone after the whistleblowers and animal rescuers. They took animal rescuer Wayne Hsiung to trial and on Nov. 30, 2023, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail for his role in nonviolent open rescues at factory farms. On the very same day of Wayne's sentencing hearing, members of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department {" "}

      <Details image="Conrad-Zoe-Rocky.jpeg">
  Following these arrests, the District Attorney filed charges against Zoe Rosenberg for the rescue of sick chickens from the Petaluma Poultry slaughterhouse that took place in June 2023 during the Animal Liberation Conference. They have not yet filed charges relating to Reichardt Duck Farm. Zoe has been forced to wear a GPS ankle monitor and follow other strict pretrial release conditions, including informing the authorities any time she leaves her home county. She also has been barred from possessing chickens, ducks, or other fowl. Clearly, they do not want Zoe rescuing any more suffering animals. Zoe's next court date is March 29, 2024 to schedule preliminary hearings.
