        Call and email Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne asking him to
        prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty, instead of prosecuting the
        people who rescued three beagles from experimentation.

      <Details image="ridglan.jpg">
        Ridglan Farms is a dog breeding and research facility in Wisconsin that
        raises beagles for cruel experiments. A few years ago, DxE investigators
        entered the facility and documented the filthy conditions and the
        psychological trauma of the dogs spinning endlessly inside small cages.
        The team rescued three beagles. Although the investigation and rescue
        happened years ago, the charging documents were filed in August 2021.
        Eva, Paul, and Wayne are facing felony burglary and felony theft
        charges. Trial is currently scheduled for November 6-10, 2023. This Right to Rescue case is an important opportunity to show the world
        the horrors inflicted on humankindâ€™s supposed best friend and to move
        toward ending experimentation on dogs and other animals.
