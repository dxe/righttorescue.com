          &nbsp;filmed inside the slaughterhouse showing chickens routinely missing the stun bath and a device designed to cut their necks, leaving it to workers to identify conscious birds before their evisceration, at a speed of 140 birds per minute. Alexandra and Alicia received theft charges in the mail in spring 2022 and pleaded not guilty. The #FosterFarmsTrial began on March 7, 2023, a full jury was selected on March 10, and the trial concluded March 17 after six hours of jury deliberation.
