      <Details image="ff.png">
        In September 2021, two activists rescued birds from a stopped slaughter
        truck that was heading into the Foster Farms slaughterhouse in
        Livingston, CA. They received theft charges in the mail in spring 2022
        and had their first court date on June 15, 2022 in Merced Superior
        Court, where they entered not guilty pleas via their attorney. At a hearing on December 13, 2022, their trial was scheduled for March 7, 2023 and it is expected to last 4-5 days.
