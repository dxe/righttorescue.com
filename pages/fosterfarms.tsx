        &nbsp;Alexandra Paul and Alicia Santurio were facing theft charges for
        rescuing two sick birds, Jax and Ethan, from a stopped slaughter truck
        that was heading into the Foster Farms slaughterhouse in Livingston, CA.
        The same day, DxE released&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWdJst8f7Sk" target="_blank">
          hidden camera footage
        </a>
        &nbsp;filmed inside the slaughterhouse showing chickens routinely
        missing the stun bath and a device designed to cut their necks, leaving
        it to workers to identify conscious birds before their evisceration, at
        a speed of 140 birds per minute. Alexandra and Alicia received theft
        charges in the mail in spring 2022 and pleaded not guilty. The
        #FosterFarmsTrial began on March 7, 2023, a full jury was selected on
        March 10, and the trial concluded March 17 after six hours of jury
        deliberation.
