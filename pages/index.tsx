          VICTORY! Just one day before trial was set to begin, all charges
          against DxE investigator Matt Johnson were DROPPED. International
          media outlets had requested coverage and people from around the
          country were planning to attend the trial to support the right to
          rescue. Could it be that the industry got scared of the public
          attention? We were going to expose Iowa Select Farms’ gruesome cruelty
          in court, but instead of going away, we are now using this victory as
          an opportunity to keep fighting "ag-gag" laws and defending the Right
          to Rescue.

          GUILTY: The jury found Wayne guilty on both counts: felony breaking or
          entering and felony larceny. The Judge issued a suspended sentence.
          Wayne will have to do two years of supervised probation and pay $250
          in restitution, but no jail time. He plans to appeal.

          Case dismissed! The felony case against Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin
          Picklesimer for rescuing turkeys from a Utah farm in 2017 was just
          dismissed because the company and prosecutor agreed that "the
          criminalization of this nonviolent investigation and rescue is
          unnecessary." This is a step toward the #RightToRescue! Please share

          We got a new case! Eva Hamer, Paul Darwin Picklesimer, and Wayne
          Hsiung were charged for rescuing three beagles from Ridglan Farms, a
          massive breeding and research facility that raises beagles for
          horrific experiments like force-feeding them laundry detergent until
          they vomit blood and die. The defendants believe the public will
          support their actions in saving these dogs.

          fence of an Iowa Select Farm during the campaign to end the use of
