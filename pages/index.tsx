        Over 100 people have been arrested on felony charges for taking
        nonviolent direct action to help suffering animals at factory farms in
        Sonoma County, after the government ignored repeated reports of criminal
        animal cruelty. On September 8th, three activists -- Cassie, Priya, and
        Wayne -- are going on trial facing conspiracy charges for their roles in
        these actions. Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) is organizing a
        convergence during the trial to support the defendants and the right to

        any species in need of rescue, including in factory farms and animal

        support for animal rescue and ultimately, to establish a legal right to
        rescue animals from distress and exploitation. This would open the door
        to a new view of animals under the law - as people deserving of rights,
        rather than "property.”

          Yesterday, Sonoma County District Attorney Robert Waner told Cassie's lawyer that he will be dismissing her from the case on Friday. We can only speculate as to why he’s dropping Cassie's charges. Maybe he wants her brilliant attorney Izaak Schwaiger out of the case. Maybe he's too overwhelmed with the mountains of evidence of animal cruelty the defense submitted to them as trial exhibits. Watch and share today's video with this news on{" "}

          In the pre-trial readiness hearing today, the prosecutor made a
          surprising announcement -- the DA's office is amending the charges
          against the defendants to remove all mention of burglary and theft,
          leaving only trespass and conspiracy to commit trespass. This might
          seem like good news, but we think it's a strategic cover-up of
          evidence relating to the "value" of the rescued animals. This comes
          after over four years in which the prosecution has zealously argued
          that the defendants took "something" of "value" from the factory
          farms, and it comes on the heels of the defense filing its exhibits
          showing the actual condition of the animals inside Sunrise Farms and
          Reichardt Duck Farm. They know the animals are treated like garbage,
          even at "humane certified," "cage-free" farms -- and they don't want
          the jury or public to see that truth. Please{" "}

          Merced County Judge Paul Lo granted the defense’s subpoena of Foster
          Farms’ records regarding the health conditions of the group of
          chickens that included the two who were rescued. Foster Farms will be
          compelled to provide evidence regarding diseased, deceased, and

          Preliminary hearings finally concluded for Cassie, Priya, and Wayne
          (and Almira took a plea deal) on Jan. 19. Judge Honigsberg said he
          needed some time to consider the defense attorneys' 17b motions
          (motions to reduce the felony counts to misdemeanors), so Cassie,
          Priya, and Wayne went back to court on February 6, 2023 to hear the
          judge's ruling. He granted the 17b motion for Cassie, saying that in
          his review of the livestreams, he had not seen her seeming to be in a
          leadership role at the actions. He denied the motions for Priya and
          Wayne. Cassie now faces 8 misdemeanors, whereas her co-defendants face
          four felonies and four misdemeanors each. Trial is expected in 2023
          for all four remaining defendants. Jon took the same plea deal as
          Almira.

          Judge Wilcox ruled, over the defense's objection, to make the jury
          anonymous. It’s a move typically reserved for trials involving violent
          organized crime, with only one known use in Utah history, before now.
          This decision could indicate to jurors that the defendants are violent
          people to be feared, instead of compassionate individuals trying to

          MOTION GRANTED! Wayne and Paul won their motion for a new jury and
          trial location because the judge agreed that Smithfield and police had

          Utah Judge Jeffrey C. Wilcox, who will preside over the
          #SmithfieldTrial, granted the State’s request to exclude the Operation
          Deathstar video and all evidence of “inhumane animal conditions” at
          trial, except to prove the value of the specific piglets who were
          rescued, Lily and Lizzie. The State argued that the footage would be
          prejudicial because it would arouse horror in the jury, but that is
          exactly why the jury should be allowed to see it.

          VICTORY! Just one day before trial was set to begin, all charges
          against DxE investigator Matt Johnson were DROPPED. International
          media outlets had requested coverage and people from around the
          country were planning to attend the trial to support the right to
          rescue. Could it be that the industry got scared of the public
          attention? We were going to expose Iowa Select Farms’ gruesome cruelty
          in court, but instead of going away, we are now using this victory as
          an opportunity to keep fighting "ag-gag" laws and defending the Right
          to Rescue.

          GUILTY: The jury found Wayne guilty on both counts: felony breaking or
          entering and felony larceny. The Judge issued a suspended sentence.
          Wayne will have to do two years of supervised probation and pay $250
          in restitution, but no jail time. He plans to appeal.

          Case dismissed! The felony case against Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin
          Picklesimer for rescuing turkeys from a Utah farm in 2017 was just
          dismissed because the company and prosecutor agreed that "the
          criminalization of this nonviolent investigation and rescue is
          unnecessary." This is a step toward the #RightToRescue! Please share

          We got a new case! Eva Hamer, Paul Darwin Picklesimer, and Wayne
          Hsiung were charged for rescuing three beagles from Ridglan Farms, a
          massive breeding and research facility that raises beagles for
          horrific experiments like force-feeding them laundry detergent until
          they vomit blood and die. The defendants believe the public will
          support their actions in saving these dogs.

          fence of an Iowa Select Farm during the campaign to end the use of
