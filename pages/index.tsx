        DxE investigator Zoe Rosenberg is facing over 5 years in prison for
        rescuing four sick chickens from a Perdue slaughterhouse in Sonoma
        County, California. She made sure the chickens, Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and
        Azalea, got the veterinary care they needed. Now, Zoe is being forced to
        wear a GPS ankle monitor and follow other strict requirements while
        awaiting her trial which starts May 16, 2025 in Santa Rosa, CA. DxE is organizing a convergence of activists around the trial to support Zoe and the right to rescue animals from abuse. Register to attend the trial convergence{" "}

          charges against UC Berkeley student and DxE animal cruelty
          investigator Zoe Rosenberg, after reviewing evidence presented at the

          DxE investigator and animal rescuer Zoe Rosenberg had her preliminary
          hearing today. The defense attorneys successfully argued that there
          was no evidence presented of a conspiracy to commit vandalism or any
          involvement in any vandalism, and the prosecutors had to agree. They
          dropped the felony conspiracy to commit vandalism charge, reducing the
          total number of felonies from four down to three. The judge said she
          will take some time to consider all the evidence presented and
          scheduled a hearing for May 13, where she will give her ruling as to
          whether there is probable cause to pursue the remaining charges. You

          Yesterday, Sonoma County District Attorney Robert Waner told Cassie's

          wants her brilliant attorney Izaak Schwaiger out of the case. Maybe

          In the pre-trial readiness hearing today, the prosecutor made a
          surprising announcement -- the DA's office is amending the charges
          against the defendants to remove all mention of burglary and theft,
          leaving only trespass and conspiracy to commit trespass. This might
          seem like good news, but we think it's a strategic cover-up of
          evidence relating to the "value" of the rescued animals. This comes
          after over four years in which the prosecution has zealously argued
          that the defendants took "something" of "value" from the factory
          farms, and it comes on the heels of the defense filing its exhibits
          showing the actual condition of the animals inside Sunrise Farms and
          Reichardt Duck Farm. They know the animals are treated like garbage,
          even at "humane certified," "cage-free" farms -- and they don't want
          the jury or public to see that truth. Please{" "}

          Harvard’s Animal Law and Policy Program Director and Law Professor
          Kristen Stilt submitted an amicus brief in the Sonoma rescue case
          asserting that animals are “someone,” and that ordinary citizens
          therefore can use the necessity defense when they are charged in
          connection with animal rescue. It might seem obvious to many of us
          that an animal is someone, but prosecutors defending animal
          agriculture have tried to argue that they aren’t and that laws like
          the necessity defense can’t be used to defend the rescue of animals
          from abuse. This new amicus brief supports what we already know: that
          animals are individuals and they have the right to be rescued from
          situations of neglect and cruelty. You can read the full amicus brief{" "}

          Merced County Judge Paul Lo granted the defense’s subpoena of Foster
          Farms’ records regarding the health conditions of the group of
          chickens that included the two who were rescued. Foster Farms will be
          compelled to provide evidence regarding diseased, deceased, and
          condemned birds from the flock that included Jax and Ethan. Previous
          attempts to obtain this kind of evidence were completely denied in
          North Carolina and Utah. This is an important victory that will
          certainly impact the trial, and future legal efforts. Read more in the

          Preliminary hearings finally concluded for Cassie, Priya, and Wayne
          (and Almira took a plea deal) on Jan. 19. Judge Honigsberg said he
          needed some time to consider the defense attorneys' 17b motions
          (motions to reduce the felony counts to misdemeanors), so Cassie,
          Priya, and Wayne went back to court on February 6, 2023 to hear the
          judge's ruling. He granted the 17b motion for Cassie, saying that in
          his review of the livestreams, he had not seen her seeming to be in a
          leadership role at the actions. He denied the motions for Priya and
          Wayne. Cassie now faces 8 misdemeanors, whereas her co-defendants face
          four felonies and four misdemeanors each. Trial is expected in 2023
          for all four remaining defendants. Jon took the same plea deal as
          Almira.

          Judge Wilcox ruled, over the defense's objection, to make the jury
          anonymous. It’s a move typically reserved for trials involving violent
          organized crime, with only one known use in Utah history, before now.
          This decision could indicate to jurors that the defendants are violent
          people to be feared, instead of compassionate individuals trying to
          protect the most vulnerable.

          MOTION GRANTED! Wayne and Paul won their motion for a new jury and
          trial location because the judge agreed that Smithfield and police had
          biased people in Beaver County, Utah. The #SmithfieldTrial will now
          take place in Washington County, Utah. This is a win for the legal
          case, as the jury pool in Washington County is less financially
          dependent on Smithfield. As a result of this change in venue, the
          trial has also been delayed to October 3-7. Please share this news on{" "}

          Former Baywatch star Alexandra Paul and co-defendant Alicia Santurio
          entered “not guilty” pleas in a new rescue case. In September 2021,
          activists rescued birds from a slaughter truck that was stopped on its

          2022, Alexandra and Alicia received theft charges in the mail related
          to this rescue.
