        In September 2021, two activists rescued chickens from a stopped slaughter truck that was heading into the Foster Farms slaughterhouse in Livingston, CA. The same day, DxE released hidden camera footage filmed inside the slaughterhouse showing chickens routinely missing the stun bath and a device designed to cut their necks, leaving it to workers to identify conscious birds before their evisceration, at a speed of 140 birds per minute. The activists received theft charges in the mail for the rescue and pleaded not guilty. Their trial has been scheduled for March 7, 2023. It is expected to last 4-5 days. DxE is organizing a court support convergence around the trial. Register to join us by&nbsp;

          Rachel and Jon finally had their preliminary hearings today, four
          years after the nonviolent mass open rescues that led to this felony
          case. Although the prosecution failed to provide evidence that Rachel
          or Jon engaged in the alleged crimes including conspiracy and
          burglary, Judge Urioste nonetheless ruled that the case would proceed
          to trial on all charges. Trial dates have not been set yet. You can

          Paul NOT GUILTY on all charges for rescuing Lily and Lizzie from

          Judge Wilcox ruled, over the defense's objection, to make the jury
          anonymous. It’s a move typically reserved for trials involving violent
          organized crime, with only one known use in Utah history, before now.
          This decision could indicate to jurors that the defendants are violent
          people to be feared, instead of compassionate individuals trying to
          protect the most vulnerable.

          MOTION GRANTED! Wayne and Paul won their motion for a new jury and
          trial location because the judge agreed that Smithfield and police had
          biased people in Beaver County, Utah. The #SmithfieldTrial will now
          take place in Washington County, Utah. This is a win for the legal
          case, as the jury pool in Washington County is less financially
          dependent on Smithfield. As a result of this change in venue, the
          trial has also been delayed to October 3-7. Please share this news

          Former Baywatch star Alexandra Paul and co-defendant Alicia Santurio
          entered “not guilty” pleas in a new rescue case. In September 2021,

          Utah Judge Jeffrey C. Wilcox, who will preside over the
          #SmithfieldTrial, granted the State’s request to exclude the Operation
          Deathstar video and all evidence of “inhumane animal conditions” at
          trial, except to prove the value of the specific piglets who were
          rescued, Lily and Lizzie. The State argued that the footage would be
          prejudicial because it would arouse horror in the jury, but that is
          exactly why the jury should be allowed to see it.
