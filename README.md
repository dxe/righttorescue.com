This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the pages by modifying `pages/*.tsx`. Your browser auto-updates as you edit the files.

## Development

New pages may need to be added to the `PAGES_TO_ALWAYS_SHRINK_NAVBAR` array for proper formatting.

The use of Bootstrap for CSS in this project is deprecated. (Tailwind for CSS might be cool.)

### Components

Documentation of the various components available for use can be found [here](README_components.md).

## Tests

Run tests with `pnpm run test`. Debug tests using the VS Code debug tab which
makes use of `launch.json`.

## Deployment

A GitHub Action automatically deploys the website to http://righttorescue.com after pushing to main.
